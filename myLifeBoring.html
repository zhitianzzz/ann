            To my future self, <br>
            No matter what happens, I hope you can be strong! <br>
            There are people who love you in this world, and you loved this world. <br>
            Please be a hard working, stoic, self-respecting person. <br>
            You have to learn to be selfish to live in this individualist world. <br>
            Please remember these notes. <br>
            From myself in the moment. <br><br>

        <p class="hiddenText">
            Please don't blame yourself. <br>
            Even if the whole world is against you, "I" will be by your side <br>
            If there is no one who trust you, I trust you; <br>
            if there is no one who needs you, I need you; <br>
            if there is no one who loves you, I love you. <br>

        <p class="hiddenText">Again, the feeling comes back. <br>
            It feels so so so so bad that there seems to be an invisible rock pressing on my chest. It’s difficult to breathe. So oppressive. <br>
            It sometimes also feels like I’m a plushy, and cotton has stuffed my chest. <br>
            Again, it’s difficult to breathe. It may also feel painful when I suddenly need a lot of oxygen. It’s like my lungs are full of flocs, and every breath needs to be filtered by the layers of flocs. <br>
            It seems like I feel bad because of something deep in me. Maybe I just feel bad mentally, but I think I’m very conscious, and my rationality tells me that’s not a big deal. <br>
            Then why am I feeling bad? <br>
            My sleep had suddenly, or maybe progressively, reduced a lot. I also don’t want to eat anything. <br>
            Indeed, I was not eating and sleeping enough.<br>
            I don’t want to do anything as well. Although I know I want to do something, there is no motivation. I don’t fully have control of myself. <br>
            It feels like I live in a plastic bag—lack of oxygen, stuffy. <br>
            It comes again; the terror of illusion is coming for me; why?<br>
            To be honest, my brain is really clear, but my body seems to be confused. <br><br>

            Suddenly feeling difficult to breathe again. It feels like I’m not happy. I also thought that I wanted to change my name earlier. It’s a little stressful as I was planning my study.<br>
            I’m feeling so unhappy. I have to distract myself, so I’m watching tv shows right now.
            My chest feels a little pain.<br>
            I think I’m a little unhappy but I’m not sure what it is. I can still be cheered up but I feel I’m not really happy. <br>
            I don’t know why my heart rate gets up easily. <br>
            I need to distract myself.<br>
            I’m not hungry but i haven’t been eating much since last night. But I’m eating. It’s meant to be tasty but I don’t think it taste good. I’m just doing it because I need it. <br>
            Maybe I couldn’t be cheered up as normal, although I was watching something seemingly interesting. <br>
            I really want to change my name. <br>
            I have to take deep breath.<br>
            I think I’m better now.<br><br>

            Writing these down is not to ask anyone to give me a pity. I now have learnt how to deal with all these emotions. <br>
            Maybe I was letting it go, so it becomes okay to finally say it out. <br>
            I haven't been opening the chat with dad for a year now. I don't want to read. I don't want to know.
            Afraid. Don't know what to afraid, but afraid. Maybe I'm just not being true to myself. <br>
            Maybe I'm just too tired. Thinking all these are so terrible. Thinking that I never really know anyone in the family.
            I think no one in this family is normal. Those who I admired, trusted, respected and loved. I love everyone in the family. But who I really love and respect? 
            It was just my own will. <br>
            I never knew my family. <br>
            We only show our best side. <br>
            We missed. <br>
            I giveup. <br>
            I don't want to be the naive child anymore. <br>
            I'm now living a good life. My mental states and physical states are stable with the help of my GP and psychologist. <br>
            I'm learning what I enjoyed. <br>
            I'm independent. <br>
            I'm fine. <br>
            But I'm tired. <br>
            I don't want to be dragged into the whirlpool of the past. <br>
            I no longer want to be "told" of all those painful things happening around me.
            When I heard the same story from all different perspectives, it was like tearing my spirit into pieces. 
            I had been pretending that I don't care and I understand everything; pretending that I'm happy and I'm mature. That just hurt.
            I know there is a little child living in my heart. She's crying. She's a child. She hasn't grownup. She's painful. She's sad. <br><br>

        <p class="hiddenText">
            Going out often makes me feel uneasy and I resist going out. It's a state of rapid heartbeat and very nervous state. I don't know what I'm afraid of, but I just feel unsafe. <br>
            I always know that there are so many support in society, and or for me, but I just don’t feel like there are enough support. I probably don’t feel safe. 
            There seems always only me confronting everything so I have to arm myself and be super tough.  <br>
            Yes I do have friends and family who I know they really care about me and will support me. And I can tell that they try to make me feel like I’m supported. But it’s just not like that. <br>
            I have an ideal self that I want to become and I’m gradually becoming this kind of person. But I’m still vulnerable inside, though I’ve been try to kill the vulnerability. 
            I tell myself I need to strong and powerful so that I have the control of my life and nothing can bother me. <br><br>
